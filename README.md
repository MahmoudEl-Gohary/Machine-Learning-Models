# Machine Learning Models

This repository contains implementations of various machine learning algorithms. Most models are built from scratch, except for the **Naive Bayes Classifier** and **SVM**, which utilize the **scikit-learn** library. Each algorithm is demonstrated with practical examples to showcase its usage in real-world scenarios.

## Models Included

### 1. Linear Regression
- Implemented from scratch for predicting continuous outcomes.

### 2. Logistic Regression
- Built from scratch for binary classification tasks using sigmoid activation.

### 3. Naive Bayes Classifier
- Implemented using **scikit-learn** for classification tasks with categorical and continuous data.

### 4. SVM with Kernels
- Utilizes **scikit-learn** for Support Vector Machines with linear and non-linear kernels.

### 5. Implementing a Neural Network From Scratch
- A basic feedforward neural network implemented entirely from scratch, demonstrating backpropagation and gradient descent.

### 6. KNN (K-Nearest Neighbors)
- Built from scratch to classify and predict outcomes based on proximity to neighbors.
